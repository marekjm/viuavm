Moves a value from one register (src) to another (dst).
These registers may be in different register sets.

After a value is moved it is no longer present in the source register, and
the source register becomes empty.
The source register must not be empty when this instruction is issued.

Being moved does not affect the value moved between registers in any way.

Any value that is present in the destination register when this instruction
is executed is deleted before the move is performed.

\heading{PASSING Arguments}{noise=true}

A special form of this instruction (where the destination register set
is "arguments") is used to pass arguments by move to a function:

\indent{}
\reflow{off}
\wrap{begin}
    text %1 local "Hello World!"
    move %0 arguments %1 local      ; pass the argument by move
\wrap{end}
\reflow{on}
\dedent{}
\break

The arguments register set is described in section \ref{registers:register_sets:arguments}.

\heading{OBTAINING Parameters}{noise=true}

Another special form of this instruction (where the source register set
is "parameters") is used to extract parameters passed to a function:

\indent{}
\reflow{off}
\wrap{begin}
    move %1 local %0 parameters
\wrap{end}
\reflow{on}
\dedent{}
\break

The parameters register set is described in section \ref{registers:register_sets:parameters}.
