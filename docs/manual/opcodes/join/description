Used to join a different process.

This instruction causes the executing process to become suspended until the process that
is the target of the instruction (whose PID is given in the second operand) finishes
running.

After the target finishes running, this instruction will either transfer a return value
of the joined process into the current process, or transfer the exception that killed
the joined process into the current one (by rethrowing it).

Using `void` as the target register causes the value returned by the process to be dropped.
