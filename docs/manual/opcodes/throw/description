Throw a value.
Thrown value is moved to the exception register (described in
section \ref{registers:register_sets:exception_register}).

Throwing a value triggers the exception handling mechanism, and
may result in a stack being unwound.
Exception handling is described in section \ref{environment.processes.error_handling.exceptions}.
Stack unwinding is described in section \ref{environment:processes:error_handling:exceptions:stack_unwinding}.
