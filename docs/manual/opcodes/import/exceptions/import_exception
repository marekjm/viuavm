\heading{IMPORT EXCEPTION}

When the import fails an `ImportException' is thrown by the VM.
The process that triggered the import can then service the exception
appropriately, choosing from several different available solutions:

\list{begin}
\item
crash
\break
This is the simplest thing to do, and requires no code to be written by the programmer.
If the `ImportException' is not caught by the process it will cause the call stack to be
unwound (stack unwinding is described in section
\ref{environment:processes:error_handling:exceptions:stack_unwinding}), and
the process will be shut down using the normal procedure (described in section
\ref{environment:processes:shut_down}).
\list{end}
