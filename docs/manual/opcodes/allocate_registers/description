Allocates a set of N local registers.
It is a compile-time error to access a register outside of allocated range.

This should always be the first instruction to appear in a normal function.
Closures should not use this instruction, though, as their register set is
externally allocated.
It is a compile-time error to put this instruction as a not-first instruction
in a function body.
