Always leave a FIXME with a comment what *exactly* do you want to be fixed here.
I guarantee you won't remember what you meant by an empty FIXME.

There are several FIXME marks to be used in the codebase. DO NOT use any other
way of marking places for fixing or you will make it unnecessarily hard to grep
for them.

The list if markers is:

- TODO: for things to do, e.g. small features or improvements
- FIXME: for bugs and cleanups

You can tag FIXME markers with these tags:

- URGENT: for bugs and cleanups that need immediate attention
- BRAINDAMAGE: for serious fuck-ups or bugs, or places where the design is so
  bad that it gives you brain damage

ALWAYS use a single line-style comment for FIXME marks, even if you need several
lines to explain what needs to be done. Leave a signature and a date - code gets
moved around and "blame" tools sometimes show different people than the original
author.

A good example of a FIXME mark:

    // FIXME This line causes the code to go *kaboom* if the process is asleep
    // due to the fact that a bar is fooed in that state. (John Doe; 2020-01-01)

A bad example of a FIXME mark:

    // FIXME
