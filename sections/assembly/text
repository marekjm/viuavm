\section{begin}

This section is a reference for Viua VM assembly language.
It discusses source code organisation and syntax.
Reading this section may allow you to understand the SYNTAX and EXAMPLES sections in
documentation for each instruction.

A listing of all instructions can be found in section \ref{isa:instructions}.
Instruction set architecture is described in section \ref{isa}.


\heading{DIRECTIVES}
\section{begin}

\heading{BLOCK}

`.block:' directive begins a block definition.
Block definitions must end with the `.end' directive.

A detailed description is provided in a later section.

\heading{BSIGNATURE}

`.bsignature:' declares that a block will be available at link time, even if it is an unresolved symbol in the
current compilation unit.

\heading{FUNCTION}{ref=assembly:directive:function}

`.function:' directive begins a function definition.
Function definitions must end with the `.end' directive.

A detailed description is provided in section \ref{assembly:blocks:functions:delimiting}.

\heading{SIGNATURE}{ref=assembly:directive:signature}

`.signature:' declares that a function should be treated "as if" the assembler is
able to resolve it.
It can be thought about as a forward declaration of a function.

The following code declares that symbol `foo/2' refers to a function name, and
that the symbol will be available at a later time so the assembler should not reject the
code:

\wrap{begin}
\indent{2}
.signature: foo/2
\dedent{2}
\wrap{end}
\break

The symbol declared using this directive must be made available either during link time
(if it is to be linked statically; static linking is described in
section \ref{tooling:linker:static_linking}), or
at runtime (if it is to be linked in dynamically; dynamic linking is described in
section \ref{tooling:kernel:dynamic_linking}).

\heading{CLOSURE}

`.closure:' directive begins a closure definition.
Closure definitions must end with the `.end' directive.

\heading{INFO}

`.info:' directive allows adding metadata to the produced binary.

\heading{IOTA}

`.iota:' directive sets the next value to be used for the `iota' symbol substitution.

\heading{IMPORT}

`.import:' directive requests that a module be statically linked to the currently compiled executable.

\heading{MARK}

`.mark:' directive sets a name for a point in a block, closure, or function body.
This name then may be used instead of an instruction index in branching instructions.
Marks are a compile-time-only feature and disappear after the source code has been converted to bytecode.
At runtime the VM uses only bytecode indexes, not marks.

NOTE FIXME
\break
\indent{2}
The assembler is currently unable to encode markers in bytecode, even as a debugging aid.
This is a deficiency that will be fixed in the future.
\dedent{2}

\heading{NAME}

`.name:' directive sets a name for a register.
Names are present only during compilation, and disappear after the source code has been converted to bytecode.
At runtime the VM uses only indexes, not names.

NOTE FIXME
\break
\indent{2}
The assembler is currently unable to encode register names in bytecode, even as a debugging aid.
This is a deficiency that will be fixed in the future.
\dedent{2}

\heading{END}{ref=assembly:directive:end}

`.end' directive is used to signal an end of a previously opened directive that requires closing.
An example of such a directive is `.function:'.


\section{end}

\heading{FUNCTIONS}{ref=assembly:functions}
\section{begin}

This section talks about functions.
All code in Viua VM programs is contained in functions, therefore it is incredibly important
to understand them.

\heading{DEFINITIONS}
\section{begin}

This section talks about how to define functions.

\heading{DELIMITING FUNCTION BODIES}{ref=assembly:blocks:functions:delimiting}
\section{begin}

A function definition is delimited by the `.function:' and `.end' tokens.
See their documentation in sections \ref{assembly:directive:function} and
\ref{assembly:directive:end} respectively.

\indent{2}
\reflow{off}
\wrap{begin}
.function: main/0
    text %1 local "Hello World!"
    print %1 local

    izero %0 local
    return
.end
\wrap{end}
\reflow{on}
\dedent{2}
\break

This example defines a function that prints "Hello World!" to the screen and returns 0.
The first line

\indent{2}
\wrap{begin}
.function: main/0
\wrap{end}
\dedent{2}
\break

contains the `.function:' token and the name of the function.
In Viua assembly function names must have the following syntax:
1/ a sequence of alphanumeric ASCII characters, colons, and underscores (this is the root part of the name),
2/ a slash character,
3/ the arity of the function (a non-negative integer number).

For example, all following names are valid:

\list{begin}
\item
main/0
\item
sqrt/1
\item
write/2
\item
vector::push_back/2
\list{end}

and all of these are invalid:

\list{begin}
\item
main
\break
no arity
\item
foo/-1
\break
negative arity
\item
in/valid
\break
invalid character inside the name
\item
vector.push_back/2
\break
invalid character inside the name
\list{end}

The arity part may be empty.
Functions with empty arity can be called with variable number of parameters.
This is discouraged, however - passing a vector of values is the preferred way to pass variable number of parameters.

The last line

\indent{2}
\wrap{begin}
.end
\wrap{end}
\dedent{2}
\break

must appear on its own.
Note the lack of a colon at the end of the token.

\section{end}

\heading{PARAMETERS}
\section{begin}

In Viua, functions do not declare the types of parameters they take; they only declare their own arity.
The assembler will ensure that once extracted inside the function the parameters are used consistently with
regard to the type (thanks to type inference).
\break
This means that types are not preserved across function boundaries.
This is a deficiency that will be fixed somewhen in the future (FIXME).

\heading{PASSING PARAMETERS}

Parameters are passed into the function using either \instruction{param} or \instruction{pamv} instruction.

\heading{EXTRACTING ARGUMENTS}

Arguments are extracted using the \instruction{arg} instruction.

\heading{ARGUMENTS REGISTER SET}

Parameters passed to a function become its arguments and are stored in a special register set.
The size of this register set depends on the function's arity - if the function takes 2 parameters, then the
size of this register set will be 2, if the function takes 1 parameter it will be 1, and
if the function takes no parameters it will be 0.

The lifetime of this register set begins just after the \instruction{frame} instruction finishes executing,
and ends just after the \instruction{return} instruction causes the call frame containing it to be popped off
the stack.

\section{end}

\heading{RETURN VALUES}
\section{begin}

When a function executes the \instruction{return} instruction its call frame is popped off the stack, and
the value contained by the local register 0 is automatically used as the return value.
Viua allows functions to return only one value, but multiple return values can be emulated by returning a
vector of values.

For more information refer to \instruction{call} instruction's documentation in
section \ref{opcode:call}.
Section \ref{storing_return_values} provides the detailed explanation of how to
store return values.

\section{end}

\section{end}

\heading{DECLARATIONS}
\section{begin}

How to declare that a function will be available during linking, and
that the assembler should just trust us that it exists.

\section{end}

\section{end}

\heading{REGISTER NAMING}
\section{begin}

How to name registers with human-readable names, e.g. `index' or `size', instead of bare
indexes - `1', `4', etc.

\section{end}
