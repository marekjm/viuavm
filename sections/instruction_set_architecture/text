\section{begin}

Viua is a CISC machine, and its instructions vary in complexity from very simple (e.g. adding two
integers) to complex and expensive ones (e.g. performing signed saturating multiplication).

\heading{INSTRUCTION CATEGORIES}
\section{begin}

Instructions provided by Viua VM can be split into the general categories described below.
This description is purely theoretical and does not manifest in the encoding of bytecode or
execution of instructions.

\heading{DATA MOVEMENT}

This category includes instructions that move data between registers in the same process as well as
instructions that move values across process boundaries (using message passing described in section
\ref{environment:processes:communication:message_passing}).

\heading{COMPUTATION}

This category includes instructions that perform computations - those that "do stuff" to put it in less fancy
terms, and because "computation" here is meant as a more general concept than simply arithmetic.
For example, modifying text values or pushing new items onto a vector is also thrown under the "computation"
umbrella.

\heading{CONTROL TRANSFER}

This category includes instructions that alter the control flow of the program.
Alteration of the control flow includes performing jumps, calling functions, spawning processes, and
throwing exceptions.

\heading{OPERANDS}
\section{begin}

Operands can be supplied to Viua VM instructions either in registers or as immediates.

\heading{REGISTER OPERANDS}

\heading{IMMEDIATES}
\section{begin}

Immediate operands come in several flavours.
Some are symbols (e.g. function names to call), some are fixed-width data (e.g. integers and addresses), and
some are variable-width data (e.g. text).

\heading{SYMBOLS}

Symbol operands are used with control-flow instructions, and encode function names.
They are variable-width immediates, but are assigned given their own category for conceptual reasons - a piece
of text is something entirely different (on the conceptual level, even if the encoding is largely similar)
than a function name.

Symbol operands are also used in constructions of
\instruction{function} (in section \ref{opcode:function}),
\instruction{closure} (in section \ref{opcode:closure}),
and
\instruction{atom} (in section \ref{opcode:atom}) instructions.

\heading{FIXED-WIDTH DATA}

\heading{VARIABLE-WIDTH DATA}

The decision to include variable-width immediates as part of the instruction may seem a dubious design choice,
but it works (as of 2018-02-05) and there are no plans to change it.
