     * offsets and insert them?
     *
     *  Nope.
     *
     *  Yes, it *would* be faster if calls were just precalculated jumps.
     *  However, by them being strings we get plenty of flexibility,
     * good-quality stack traces, and a place to put plenty of debugging
     * info. All that at a cost of just one map lookup; the overhead is
     * minimal and gains are big. What's not to love?
     *
     *  Of course, you, my dear reader, are free to take this code (it's GPL
     * after all!) and modify it to suit your particular needs - in that
     * case that would be calculating call jumps at compile time and
     * exchanging CALL instructions with JUMP instructions.
     *
     *  Good luck with debugging your code, then.
