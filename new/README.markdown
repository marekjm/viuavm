# Viua VM

Viua is a bytecode virtual machine designed for reliable execution of massively
concurrent programs. Internals of the VM are designed to allow running as much
of the code as reasonably possible in parallel, taking advantage of manycore
processors. The ISA presented to users exposes an execution model based on the
Actor Model.

## Transparent execution

Linux uses `binfmt_misc` loader to provide support for various executable file
formats. See https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html
for more information.

Viua VM binaries can be executed "transparently" (ie, without explicitly passing
them to the interpreter) using this infrastructure. For one-time testing you can
use the following command, executed as root:

    # cat ./binfmt.d/viua-exec.conf > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

For a more permanent solution install the file in /usr/local/lib/binfmt.d or
consult `binfmt.d(5)` for information about appropriate installation directory
on your system. Remember to check and adjust the interpreter's location if
necessary!
